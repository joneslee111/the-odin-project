 <h1 align="center"> Rock Paper Scissors - The Odin Project </h1> <br>

As part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors), you are challenged to create a working example of Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) using JavaScript. Initially, you start off by producing an in console game using prompts as the players move, then, as you progress on the course you are challenged to improve the game with a working UI - essentially taking it away from the console. In this README I will be detailing the things I've learnt and also the things I'd like to improve/add to.

## How It Works
* Player inserts their name
* Player chooses their move and the computer automatically chooses its move
* Outcome of the round is revealed
* When either the player or the computer reaches a score of 5, the game ends
* Game reveals winner
* Reset button appears, which when clicked refreshes the page
